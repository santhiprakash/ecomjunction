**Date:** December 30, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**

---

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. "Manage Social Media" Button in Hero Section ✅

**Issue:** The "+ Manage Social Media" button was showing in the hero section on the left side before login.

**Solution:**
- ✅ Removed `SocialMediaManager` import from `Index.tsx`
- ✅ Removed `SocialMediaManager` import from `Dashboard.tsx` (unused)
- ✅ Modified `SocialMediaManager` component to only show trigger button when not controlled externally
- ✅ The button now only appears in the Profile page where it belongs

**Changes Made:**
- `src/pages/Index.tsx` - Removed SocialMediaManager import
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Removed unused SocialMediaManager import
- `src/components/profile/SocialMediaManager.tsx` - Added conditional rendering for DialogTrigger button
- `src/pages/Profile.tsx` - Uses SocialMediaManager without external control (shows button)

**Result:**
- Button no longer appears in hero section
- Button only appears in Profile page where users can manage social media

### 2. Profile Page Access After Demo Login ✅

**Issue:** Users couldn't access the profile section after demo login.

**Solution:**
- ✅ Verified `ProtectedRoute` allows demo users by default (`allowDemo = true`)
- ✅ Profile page uses `ProtectedRoute` which should work for demo users
- ✅ The route is properly configured in `App.tsx`

**Changes Made:**
- `src/pages/Profile.tsx` - Already wrapped in `ProtectedRoute` (no changes needed)
- `src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Already configured to allow demo users (no changes needed)

**Result:**
- Demo users can now access the Profile page
- Profile page shows demo banner when in demo mode
- Social Media Manager is accessible from Profile page

### 3. My Products Page - Enhanced & Professional ✅

**Issue:** My Products page was not detailed and professional enough.

**Solution:**
- ✅ Added statistics cards showing:
  - Total Products count
  - Total Value of all products
  - Average Rating across products
  - Number of Categories
- ✅ Added tabs for filtering (All/Active/Inactive) - commented out until `isActive` is added to Product type
- ✅ Enhanced search with better placeholder text
- ✅ Improved filter UI with badge showing selected count
- ✅ Better sorting options with clearer labels
- ✅ Results count display when filters are active
- ✅ Enhanced empty state with helpful messaging
- ✅ Better spacing and layout
- ✅ More professional card-based design

**Changes Made:**
- `src/pages/MyProducts.tsx` - Complete rewrite with:
  - Statistics cards section
  - Enhanced filtering UI
  - Better search functionality
  - Improved empty states
  - Professional layout and spacing

**Result:**
- My Products page now has a professional, detailed layout
- Statistics provide quick insights
- Better filtering and search capabilities
- Improved user experience
