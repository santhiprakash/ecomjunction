## 📦 Implementation Status

### 1. Storage Service Created ✅
**File:** `src/lib/storage.ts`

**Features:**
- ✅ File upload (`uploadFile`)
- ✅ Image upload with optimization (`uploadImage`)

- ✅ File existence check (`fileExists`)
- ✅ Signed URL generation (`getSignedUrlForFile`)
- ✅ File listing (`listFiles`)
- ✅ Configuration check (`isR2Configured`)

### 2. Dependencies Installed ✅
- ✅ `@aws-sdk/client-s3` - S3/R2 client
- ✅ `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner` - Signed URL generation
- ✅ `sharp` - Image optimization
- ✅ `@types/sharp` - TypeScript types

### 3. Test Script Created ✅
**File:** `scripts/test-r2.js`  
**Command:** `npm run test:r2`

## ⚠️ Note on R2_PUBLIC_URL Format

Your current `R2_PUBLIC_URL` is:
```
https://fd87fefa79843d0acb93af6032a4517d.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/shopmatic
```

**Important:** This format includes the bucket name in the path. Depending on your R2 bucket configuration, you may need to adjust this.

### Option 1: If Bucket is Public
If your bucket is configured as public in Cloudflare dashboard, the public URL format could be:
- `https://{bucket-name}.{account-id}.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`
- Or a custom domain if configured

### Option 2: Custom Domain (Recommended)
If you configure a custom domain in Cloudflare R2:
1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → R2 → Your Bucket → Settings
2. Add a custom domain (e.g., `cdn.shopmatic.cc`)
3. Update `R2_PUBLIC_URL` to: `https://cdn.shopmatic.cc`

### Option 3: R2.dev Subdomain
If using R2's public subdomain:
- The URL format would be: `https://pub-{hash}.r2.dev`
- Get this from your bucket's public URL settings

**Current Status:** The URL format you have works for now (test passed), but you may want to verify file accessibility via this URL. If files are not publicly accessible, you may need to:
1. Enable public access for the bucket in Cloudflare dashboard
2. Or configure a custom domain
3. Or use signed URLs (which the code supports)

## 🧪 Testing Results

```
✅ Configuration check: All variables present
✅ Credentials validation: Valid
✅ Bucket access: Successful
✅ File upload: Successful
✅ File deletion: Successful
✅ Test file cleanup: Complete
```

**Current bucket status:**
- Bucket exists: ✅
- Access permissions: ✅ (Read & Write)
- Files in bucket: 0 (empty, ready for use)

## 📝 Usage in Application

### Import the storage service:
```typescript
import { storage, uploadFile, uploadImage } from '@/lib/storage';
```

### Upload a file:
```typescript
const fileBuffer = ...; // Your file buffer
const url = await uploadFile(fileBuffer, 'path/to/file.jpg', 'image/jpeg');
```

### Upload an image (with optimization):
```typescript
const imageBuffer = ...; // Your image buffer
const url = await uploadImage(imageBuffer, 'products/image.jpg', {
  width: 1200,
  quality: 85,
  format: 'jpeg'
});
```

### Check if R2 is configured:
```typescript
import { isR2Configured } from '@/lib/storage';

if (isR2Configured()) {
  // R2 is ready to use
} else {
  // Handle fallback (e.g., use external URLs)
}
```

## 🔄 Next Steps

### 1. Test File Accessibility (Recommended)
Test if files uploaded to R2 are accessible via the public URL:

```bash
# Upload a test file using the storage service
# Then try accessing it via the R2_PUBLIC_URL
```

### 2. Configure Custom Domain (Optional but Recommended)
- Better for branding
- Better for CDN performance
- Cleaner URLs

### 3. Implement Upload UI
- Add file upload components to your application
- Use the storage service for product images
- Use the storage service for user avatars

**Note:** Verify public file accessibility if you plan to use public URLs. Otherwise, the code supports signed URLs which will work regardless.
