# Production Readiness & Accessibility Improvements

## Error Handling
- Added a reusable ErrorBoundary component to catch and display React errors gracefully.
- Wrapped the entire app in ErrorBoundary in App.tsx.

## Notification System
- Consolidated to a single notification system (custom Toaster), removed Sonner from the main app tree.

## React Strict Mode
- Wrapped the app in <React.StrictMode> in main.tsx for better development practices.

## Accessibility (a11y)
- All form fields in AddProductForm have associated labels and IDs.
- Added role="button", tabIndex=0, and aria-label to tag/category remove icons for keyboard and screen reader accessibility.
- Added keyboard event handler (Enter/Space) for tag/category remove icons.
- Added a visually hidden ARIA live region for error messages in AddProductForm for screen reader support.
- Confirmed that UI primitives (inputs, selects, dialogs, carousels) use accessible patterns via Radix and Tailwind.

## Next Steps
- Continue a11y audit for other forms and interactive components.
- Add inline error feedback and ARIA live regions for all major forms.
- Expand documentation as further improvements are made.
